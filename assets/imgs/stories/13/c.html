<p>El Capitan, a traveler bold and free,
Set sail for China’s distant, ancient lands,
Where rivers flow and forests whisper, see,
The temples rising where the green expands.</p>

<p>In markets bustling with life’s vibrant beat,
He wandered, tasting all the land's delights,
From fragrant teas to dishes rich and sweet,
And lanterns glowing softly in the night.</p>

<p>Inspired by the flavors he did find,
He learned the art of dumplings from a sage,
With vegetables and spices well combined,
He mastered recipes of every age.</p>

<p>El Capitan, with wisdom in his hand,
Returned to share the tastes of China's land.</p>
