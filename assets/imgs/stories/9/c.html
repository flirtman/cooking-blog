El Capitanâ€™s Gnocchi ai Funghi

<p>El Capitan, with hands both skilled and true,
Rolls out the gnocchi, smooth as morning light,
He shapes each piece, with patience, not askew,
A simple craft turned into pure delight.</p>

<p>In olive oil, the garlic starts to sing,
As mushrooms join, their scent a rich perfume,
With wine and herbs, they dance, they twist, they cling,
And fill the pan with flavors that consume.</p>

<p>The gnocchi simmer, tender in their prime,
Then tossed with butter, cream, and touch of sage,
He lifts the dish, a masterpiece in time,
A taste that speaks of more than just the age.</p>

<p>So take a bite, and let your senses know,
The warmth of Italy in every glow.</p>
