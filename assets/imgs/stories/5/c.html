<p>El Capitan, at dawn's first light,
Prepares his dish with skill and grace,
A tankini duck, cooked golden bright,
With rice to fill its rightful place.</p>

<p>Beside, the broccoli, fresh and green,
Mushrooms and carrots join the play,
All tossed and turned in wokâ€™s sheen,
A vibrant mix to greet the day.</p>

<p>With every stir, the flavors blend,
Each spice and herb a joyful sound,
As vegetables and duck commend
The feast that soon shall all astound.</p>

<p>El Capitan, his task complete,
Serves up a meal both bold and sweet.</p>
