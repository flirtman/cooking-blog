At dawn he wakes, the sea still in his veins,
The Capitan, with care, begins his art.
He wields his pan as if it held the reins,
Creating meals to stir his lover's heart.

The eggs he poaches soft, their centers gold,
With ribbons of warm sauce, they gently shine.
Upon the ham, their creamy folds take hold,
And cherry tomes with dew are placed in line.

A steaming cup of tea, a lemon’s zest,
Completes the tray he carries to her side.
Her sleepy smile confirms he’s passed the test,
For in his work, his love cannot be denied.

Oh, Capitan, your heart and hands align,
To craft a feast where love and taste combine.
