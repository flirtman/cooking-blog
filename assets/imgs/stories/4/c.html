<p>Beneath the sun, where ocean waves break free,
El Capitan stands tall with calm and might,
Prepares a feast of noodles by the sea,
A broth of speed and savory delight.</p>

<p>With deft, quick hands he slices tender beef,
Boiled eggs are halved and gleam in golden glow,
And ginger’s warmth brings spice beyond belief,
While soy and broth unite in fragrant flow.</p>

<p>The noodles swirl, entwined in smoky steam,
Green onions sprinkled like the morning dew,
He ladles bowls, a sailor's fleeting dream,
A soup that’s swift, yet deep in flavor true.</p>

<p>On deck they savor, basked in sunlit gleam,
El Capitan's creation, pure as a dream.</p>
