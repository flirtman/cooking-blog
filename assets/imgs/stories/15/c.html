<p>In days of old when sailors ruled the seas,
El Capitan, with pan and wok in hand,
Did stir the rice with skill and perfect ease,
Creating dishes legendary, grand.</p>

<p>His fried rice, Asian style, a seafaring delight,
With soy and spices dancing in the breeze,
Brought joy to all who tasted every bite,
A culinary wonder sure to please.</p>

<p>The crew would gather 'round with eager eyes,
To watch him cook, their tummies filled with cheer,
He’d toss and flip, beneath the starry skies,
Their laughter mixing with the night’s cool air.</p>

<p>El Capitan, the master of the sea,
And fried rice king, for all eternity.</p>
