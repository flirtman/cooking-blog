<p>Upon the deck where salty breezes blow,
El Capitan commands with eyes so keen,
A master of the sea where currents flow,
And of the kitchen, where his craft is seen.</p>

<p>With steady hand, he carves the ocean's prize,
A lobster, fresh and bright from morning's catch,
Each movement sure, beneath the azure skies,
He works with grace, no challenge left to match.</p>

<p>In butter's golden pool, his dish takes flight,
With garlic's fragrant kiss, a touch of lime,
He conjures flavors, simple yet so bright,
Transforming meals into a taste sublime.</p>

<p>El Capitan, of sea and stove the king,
In every dish, his passion's song does sing.</p>
