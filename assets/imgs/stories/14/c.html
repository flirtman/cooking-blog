<p>Through Paris streets, El Capitan once roved,
A culinary master of the arts.
With chef’s resolve, his craft he deftly proved,
Creating dishes that delight the hearts.</p>

<p>From markets fresh, he gathered champignons,
And mustard seeds to blend with veal so fine.
A secret sauce, a Parisian anon,
Enhances flavors, rich like vintage wine.</p>

<p>Rognon à la moutarde, a bold delight,
A triumph in the city’s bustling grace.
El Capitan, beneath the city lights,
Brings Paris charm to every warm embrace.</p>

<p>A master’s touch in kitchens far and near,
A French cuisine, with soul and skill sincere.</p>
