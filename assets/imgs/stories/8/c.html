<p>Upon the flame, El Capitan does stand,
With salmon fillets sizzling in his pan,
Their golden edges kissed by seasoned hand,
A feast begun, according to his plan.</p>

<p>The fragrant rice steams soft beside the heat,
Its grains absorbing spices from the air,
A pairing rich, both simple and complete,
Crafted with utmost skill and tender care.</p>

<p>He turns the fish, its skin crisped to perfection,
A splash of oil sends waves of scent to rise.
The kitchen hums with flavors of affection,
A masterâ€™s dish beneath the starry skies.</p>

<p>El Capitan, with grace and skill so fine,
Transforms his humble meal to one divine.</p>
