<p>Beneath the towering cliffs of granite stone,
El Capitan, in eveningâ€™s gentle glow,
Prepares the quail, its secrets all his own,
To roast within the oven's steady flow.</p>

<p>He brushes olive oil with patient grace,
And sprinkles basilic, a touch divine,
Then slides the quail into its warm embrace,
Where heat will turn the flesh to tender wine.</p>

<p>The oven hums, a steady, soothing sound,
As quail transforms within its heated womb,
No flame is needed, no great fire around,
Just even warmth to guide it to its bloom.</p>

<p>Beneath the stars, the mountain rests in peace,
As El Capitan serves his masterpiece.</p>
