<p>El Capitan stands tall, his stance so sure,
With knife in hand, he tends to chicken's flesh.
Upon the board, the fillets rest, so pure,
As he prepares his dish, each stroke is fresh.</p>

<p>With practiced grace, he pounds the meat so thin,
Creating perfect cuts with tender care.
A sprinkle here, a dash of spice within,
He crafts with art, each flavor rich and rare.</p>

<p>The pan is hot, the butter starts to melt,
A golden crust forms crisp beneath the flame.
He flips with ease, as if the heat were felt
By none but him, his passion like a claim.</p>

<p>The Pollo Paillard, a feast of simple grace,
El Capitan's art, with love and skill embraced.</p>
