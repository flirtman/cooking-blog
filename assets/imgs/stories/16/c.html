<p>Upon the grill, with sizzle, flame, and cheer,
Lays salmon pink, a fish both grand and bright.
El Capitan, the cook we hold so dear,
Prepares his feast beneath the stars' soft light.</p>

<p>With spatula in hand, he flips with flair,
A chef renowned, with hat perched high and proud.
The salmon dances, golden in the air,
Its flavor sings, delightful, clear, and loud.</p>

<p>"Taste the sea!" he cries with jovial tone,
As diners cheer and clap, a hungry throng.
With every bite, their joy is deeply sown,
El Capitan, the king of grill and song.</p>

<p>So hereâ€™s to salmon, cooked with love and thrill,
And to our captain, master of the grill.</p>
