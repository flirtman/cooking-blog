Tuscan butter salmon with tortellini:

<p>Beneath El Capitan's majestic gaze,
A chef prepares a feast of grand delight,
With Tuscan butter in the fire's blaze,
He crafts a meal to match the mountain's height.</p>

<p>The salmon sears with herbs and garlic's kiss,
Its tender flesh a masterpiece in gold,
While tortellini, soft in buttery bliss,
Dance in the pan as stories old unfold.</p>

<p>Each bite a journey through the Tuscan hills,
Where vineyards stretch beneath the sun's embrace,
And every flavor in the dish fulfills
A taste of Italy in nature's grace.</p>

<p>El Capitan looks on, both proud and still,
As man and mountain share this perfect thrill.</p>
