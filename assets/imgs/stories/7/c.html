<p>Patate al Forno, golden, crisp, and bright,
Begin the feast with fragrant herbs in tow.
El Capitan, by midday’s warming light,
Attends each slice as olive oils flow.</p>

<p>With garlic cloves and rosemary to blend,
He roasts until the edges brown and curl.
Each bite, a mix of earth and sea’s commend,
The humble spud transformed, its flavors swirl.</p>

<p>Then comes the salmon, set to sizzle low,
Its skin a crisp, its flesh a tender pink.
Together, side by side, their warmth to show,
A feast of taste and scent, in midday’s blink.</p>

<p>So Capitan delights in simple fare,
His midday meal a craft beyond compare.</p>
