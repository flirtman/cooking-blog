El Capitan's Carbonara Feast

<p>
El Capitan stands tall beneath the sky,
With morning light that warms his rugged face;
In sturdy pan, the guanciale shall fry,
A dance of crisp and sizzle fills the space.
</p>
<p>
He stirs the pasta, golden strands take flight,
While eggs and cheese are whisked into a cream;
The crack of blackened pepper in the light,
Completes his vision, more than just a dream.
</p>
<p>
He merges all, the pan's heat lends embrace,
No cream in sight—tradition holds its ground;
The sauce, like silk, entwines with tender grace,
As laughter echoes, joy and love profound.
</p>
<p>
El Capitan, with every bite, we cheer,
His Carbonara sings—a taste sincere.
