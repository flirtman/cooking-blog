<p>In the kitchen, bright and clean,
An octopus with limbs both deft and sly,
Dreamed of adventures far beyond cuisine,
Yet found himself where sea meets pan and fry.</p>

<p>He danced with garlic, butter, lemon zest,
Avoiding pots and pans with crafty ease.
El Capitan, the chef, aimed for the best,
But octopus, with humor, sought to tease.</p>

<p>"Oh fate!" he cried, "to be a gourmet treat,
When I could swim through coral reefs so wide.
Instead, I'm here, where hot and cold compete,
My destiny to serve, yet still with pride."</p>

<p>In El Capitan's domain, he played his part,
A culinary jest, a chef's fine art.</p>
